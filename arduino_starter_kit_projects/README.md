# Arduino Practice Projects

We are learning to write code and build Arduino based projects by following
the Arduino Projects Book which can be found in the [Arduino Starter Kit](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit).

Visit the [project blog](https://ish256.github.io/Arduino_Practice_Projects/) to
see the completed project results!
